# Find mutation in non-coding region.

## SNP analysis
The result and process is in this directory, call mutation_summary.

## INDEL analysis
The INDEL result was analyzed, maybe I can find something in INDEL analysis even though the INDEL calling is not that reliable.

## Add 2016-12-28 summary
Write the summary using RMarkdown. And reorganize the mutationInPromoter file.

## 01. summary the mutation affect PDE4DIP transcript expression
1. ENSR maybe an enhancer, point mutation occur in the TCF7L2 binding region may affect the affinity between TCF7L2 and DNA.
2. ENSG00000313431 transcripts expression have siginificant change between MT, WT and NM.
3. Many TFs can bind to the PDE4DIP promoters, including TCF7L2, EP300 and BRCA1.
4. TCF7L2 can interact with EP300 from PPI data.

## 02 Methylation impact 
Methylation impact to PDE4DIP expression. The simplified expression model is cg12594911     mutation

## 03 Survival analysis
Survival analysis was performed on mutation and expression respectively. The number of clinical samples limit the performance of survival analysis. Only three dead sample exist among the clinical data.
